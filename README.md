# OpenSEES_Models_CBF

This folder contains ready-to-run 2-dimensional OpenSEES models of four archetype steel buildings designed with perimeter special concentrically-braced frames (SCBFs), with heights of 3, 6, 12 and 16-story.

Note that now you can generate further frame configurations using the new FM-2D software (https://github.com/amaelkady/FM-2D).
